            Our Services offer you the ability to register and login using your third
            party social media account details (like your Facebook or Twitter logins).
            Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information about
            you from your social media provider. The profile Information we receive may
            vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include
            your name, e-mail address, friends list, profile picture as well as other
            information you choose to make public.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are
            described in this privacy notice&nbsp;or that are otherwise made clear to you
            on the Services. Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible
            for, other uses of your personal information by your third party social media
            provider. We recommend that you review their privacy policy to understand how
            they collect, use and share your personal information, and how you can set
            your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.

          <p>
            We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for
            the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period
            is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal
            requirements). No purpose in this policy will require us keeping your personal
            information for longer than 2 years past the termination of the user's
            account.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal
            information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not
            possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in
            backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and
            isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

          <p>
            We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures
            designed to protect the security of any personal information we process.
            However, please also remember that we cannot guarantee that the internet
            itself is 100% secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal
            information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is
            at your own risk. You should only access the services within a secure
            environment.

            are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor
            dependent&rsquo;s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information
            from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate
            the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our
            records. If you become aware of any data we have collected from children under
            age 18, please contact us at faraz@retro.app.

          </p>
          <p>
            Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications
            include a Do-Not-Track (&ldquo;DNT&rdquo;) feature or setting you can activate
            to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing
            activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for
            recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do
            not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that
            automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard
            for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will
            inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.
